description: Analyse a website's requirements before any test case is written — read the requirement documents the tester put in artifacts/<host>/requirements/, explore the live site, and infer business rules where no document covers them. Use when asked to analyse requirements, business rules or business flows of a web app, or as the first step of testing a site. Produces artifacts/<host>/requirements.md for the tester to approve (gate G1). Step 1 of the web-test workflow.
---

Turn requirement documents and the live site into a reviewable list of testable requirements.
Step 1 of the `web-test` workflow. Output: `artifacts/<host>/requirements.md`, which the tester
approves (gate **G1**) before `test-designer` writes a single test case.

Run from the tester's work folder. `<host>` = the URL's host (e.g. `dev.brse.ai`).

## Start

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/web-test/gate.mjs" https://app.example.com
```

If `requirements.md` already exists, update it in place (see "Updating") — never copy the
template over it.

## What to achieve

1. **Read the documents** in `artifacts/<host>/requirements/` (docx, pdf, md, xlsx): PDF and
   Markdown with Read, docx and xlsx through the `docx` / `xlsx` skills. The folder may be empty
   or missing; then every requirement comes from the site.
2. **Explore the live site** (below) to learn what actually exists.
3. **Split into testable requirements**, one row each, `REQ-NNN`. "User can manage orders" is
   not testable; "Deleting an order asks for confirmation first" is.
4. **Compare documents with the site:**
   - in the documents, not on the site → a row in "Câu hỏi cần làm rõ" (maybe a missing feature);
   - on the site, not in the documents → a new REQ with Nguồn `Suy luận`.
5. **Set the initial status** (table below).
6. Group REQs into **Luồng nghiệp vụ** — the end-to-end journeys a user takes.
7. Write "Việc của bạn trước khi duyệt" (2–5 concrete items for this round), leave the approval
   line at `⬜ Chờ duyệt`, and stop at G1.

## Status rules

| Where the REQ comes from | Nguồn | Trạng thái | Xác nhận bởi |
|---|---|---|---|
| A requirement document | `<file> <section>` | Đã xác nhận | the file name |
| A standard every site must meet (masked password, no data of other users, no JS errors, clear validation) | Chuẩn chung | Đã xác nhận | QA |
| Obvious behaviour seen on the site (Logout logs out, search returns matches) | Suy luận | Chấp nhận tạm | — |
| A business rule seen on the site (fees, limits, approvals, lockouts) | Suy luận | Cần hỏi | — |

**Never mark an inferred business rule `Đã xác nhận`.** Inference describes what the site
*does*, not what it *must* do; testing it against itself proves nothing. Only a document or the
PO can confirm a business rule. A test that passes on a `Chấp nhận tạm` REQ only shows the site
has not changed since exploration — say so whenever you report it.

## Explore — three ways, by difficulty

If `explore.mjs` or `crawl.mjs` exits **4**, Playwright is not installed in this work folder:
run the `web-test-agent:setup` skill, then repeat the command.

**Default — Playwright headless** (fast, captures evidence to `artifacts/<host>/`):
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/test-designer/explore.mjs" https://brse.ai
```
Writes `exploration.md` (redirects, status, console errors, failed requests, outline
of every field/button/link), `screenshot.png` (**open and look**), `console.json`,
`network.json`. Reach a page behind a click/login with `--steps steps.json` (array of
`{fill|click|waitFor|goto}`).

**Large site, or most of it behind a login — crawl first:**
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/test-designer/crawl.mjs" https://app.example.com
```
Logs in as each role in `WEBTEST_ROLES` (credentials `TEST_<ROLE>_EMAIL` /
`TEST_<ROLE>_PASSWORD`, or `TEST_EMAIL` / `TEST_PASSWORD` for the default role — from the
shell, `.env.<host>`, then `.env`; login page `WEBTEST_LOGIN_PATH`, default `/login`),
follows same-origin links, `sitemap.xml` and the routes declared in the SPA's JS bundle
(React Router / Vue Router / Angular configs), groups URLs into route templates
(`/orders/:id`), and writes `artifacts/<host>/crawl/site-map.md`. Read it before anything else:
- **Warnings at the top** mean coverage is incomplete (page or time limit, rate limiting, a
  session that kept expiring). Say so in the analysis.
- **Templates / Files** are the feature areas; `URLs seen` shows how big each is. Open
  `crawl/pages/<...>/exploration.md` (and its screenshot) only for templates you judge risky.
- **Access matrix** rows where roles differ are authorization rules: each is a REQ
  ("role X cannot open Y"). A `[file]` row that differs is a data-exposure rule. A cell reading
  `redirected → /home` means the page answered but the app (often the SPA itself, after an
  HTTP 200) sent that role elsewhere: the UI refuses it — whether the server does too is for
  test design to check. `API 404` / `API 403` means the page answered 200 but its own API
  refused that role while it loaded: the server denies the data. An SPA answers 200 for every
  URL, so `allowed` only means the page and its API calls succeeded — open the page as that
  role before calling a row a data leak.
- **Routes from JS bundle** lists routes no link points to — pages the UI only reaches through
  buttons. `opened` ones are crawled like links; `unsafe` and `no-id` (a `:param` no crawled
  page could fill) ones are not — cover them with chrome-devtools MCP if they matter.
- **Skipped URLs** under Warnings were never opened because they look state-changing (logout,
  delete, export...). If one is safe and matters, rerun with `--allow <regex>`.

It only follows links and never clicks or submits, which makes it fit for production — with
the redirect caveat under Gotchas. Limits:
`--max-pages` 200 per role, `--max-depth` 5, `--max-minutes` 15, `--delay-ms` 250,
`--samples` 3 per template.

**When that's not enough — chrome-devtools MCP** (interactive, for auth-gated / heavy
SPA / dynamic content): drive the real browser to understand the flow —
the chrome-devtools MCP tools `navigate_page`, `take_snapshot`, `click`, `fill`,
`list_console_messages`, `list_network_requests`.

**Then look behind the clicks.** The crawler never clicks, so dialogs, menus and panels are
not in its outlines. Open each one (Start/Create buttons, user menu, Delete, Share, Feedback,
Edit...) and **cancel** it — never submit — to learn its fields and validation messages. A
throwaway Playwright script in your scratchpad, or chrome-devtools MCP, both work. Validation
messages are the best source of business rules: write each one down as a REQ candidate.

## Write requirements.md

Only for a host with no file yet:

```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/<host>
cp -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/requirement-analyst/templates/requirements.template.md" artifacts/<host>/requirements.md
```

Worked example: `examples/brse.ai.requirements.md`. The Requirement table is read by scripts:
keep the header row starting with `| REQ |`, one REQ per row, ids `REQ-NNN`.

## Updating

Keep every row and its id. New REQs take the next id after the highest. A REQ that no longer
applies gets Trạng thái `Bỏ` — never delete the row (an older plan may still point to it). When
the tester answers a question, move the answer into the REQ and change its status. **Any content
change resets the approval line to `⬜ Chờ duyệt`**, and G2 must then be approved again.

## Hand off (G1)

Tell the tester, in plain Vietnamese: how many REQs per status, the open questions, what the
documents have that the site lacks (and the reverse), and the path of `requirements.md`. Ask them
to review and edit it, answer or forward the questions, then say "duyệt". **Only after they say
so**, write the approval line:

```
> **Duyệt:** ✅ Đã duyệt — <name> — <YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm>
```

`<name>` from `git config user.name` unless the tester gives another; time from the local clock.
Then hand over to `test-designer`.

## Gotchas
- Requirement documents belong to the client. They stay under `artifacts/` (gitignored); never
  copy them anywhere else or quote them at length outside the bundle.
- `Cần hỏi` REQs may stay open at G1; step 2 designs no test case for them until answered.
- `explore.mjs` waits for `networkidle`; websocket/long-poll sites may time out (30s) —
  it still captures what loaded and logs the nav error. Switch to chrome-devtools MCP for those.
- Empty button label in the outline = icon-only button; identify by `aria-label`, not text.
- `crawl.mjs` login fails with `field-not-found`: the form is not at `/login` — set
  `WEBTEST_LOGIN_PATH`. SSO and MFA are not supported; use chrome-devtools MCP for those.
- The crawler aborts requests a page itself makes to a state-changing URL, but it cannot
  intercept a server-side redirect to one — whether the redirect answers a link, an image or
  a fetch. Keep `--exclude` for known dangerous paths.
- Bundle route discovery reads only the start page's own `<script>` / `modulepreload` files
  (up to 20). Next.js route manifests are not read, relative child routes are skipped, and a
  JS-only app with no router config yields nothing. Turn it off with `--no-bundle-routes`.
- `artifacts/<host>/.auth/*.json` holds live session tokens. It is gitignored with the rest of
  `artifacts/`; never copy it elsewhere.
