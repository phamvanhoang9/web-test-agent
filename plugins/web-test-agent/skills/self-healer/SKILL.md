description: Diagnose failing Playwright tests on the live page and propose fixes for approval. Use when web tests fail, are flaky, or need self-healing/repair. Uses chrome-devtools MCP to inspect the real DOM/console/network. Part of step 3 (execute) of the web-test workflow, on failure.

Repair failing web tests. Part of step 3 (execute) of the `web-test` workflow, triggered when
test-runner reports failures. Its proposal is what lets gate G3 pass: every failed TC must be
classified in it. **Diagnoses on the live page, then proposes a fix and
waits for your approval — it never auto-applies changes.**

Run from the tester's work folder. Work per failing case from `artifacts/<host>/quality-gate.md`.

## What to achieve
For each failure, find the *real* cause by looking at the actual page, then decide:
- **Real app bug** → report it clearly (TC, expected vs actual, evidence). Do **not**
  "fix" the test to hide it.
- **Flaky / wrong script** (stale selector, race, bad assumption) → propose a minimal
  spec fix.

## Start from the trace
Every failing PW test keeps a trace at `artifacts/<host>/test-results/<test>/trace.zip`
(`npx playwright show-trace <path>`): DOM snapshots before/after each action, how each
locator resolved, and network/console on one timeline. It records *the run that failed*,
so read it first — timing- or data-dependent failures may not reproduce on the live page.

## Diagnose on the live page (chrome-devtools MCP)
The Playwright error alone is often not enough — inspect reality:
- chrome-devtools `navigate_page` to the failing URL (set up auth via steps if needed)
- `take_snapshot` — the real accessibility tree → find the correct role/label/selector
- `list_console_messages` / `list_network_requests` — JS errors or failing API calls behind the symptom
- `click` / `fill` / `wait_for` to reproduce the step that failed and see what actually happens

Map the symptom to a cause:
| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|
| `locator not found` | selector changed / wrong | use the role/label seen in the snapshot |
| `timeout waiting for visible` | element loads late / behind state | web-first assertion or wait for the right precondition |
| assertion mismatch | app changed, or expectation wrong | confirm on live page → fix test OR report app bug |
| passes alone, fails in suite | shared state / order | isolate state, fix setup/teardown |

Selector guidance: `resources/knowledge/selector-resilience.md` (in script-generator).

## Propose — don't apply
The reader is a tester, not a developer: **never hand over a diff or a patch file.** Write the
proposal in the user's language, in plain words, and save the same content to
`artifacts/<host>/heal-proposal.md` so it can be shared.

1. **Real app bugs** first — one row each: TC, what the user does, what should happen, what
   happens instead, evidence (screenshot path, HTTP status), and the cause in one sentence
   (result-analyst groups TCs with the same cause into one bug). These tests stay red.
   **Every failed TC of the latest run must appear in `heal-proposal.md`** — `gate.mjs`
   counts the missing ones as unclassified, and G3 cannot pass while any remain.
2. **Test fixes** — one row each: TC, what went wrong in plain words ("the Upload button opens
   a window first; the test expected a file picker"), and what the test will do instead.
3. **Passed, but wrong** — a test that passed for the wrong reason is worse than a failure;
   list it with the same two columns.
4. Ask one question: apply the test fixes and re-run the whole suite? **Only after a yes**,
   edit the specs, re-run, and loop until the remaining failures are all real bugs.

Show code only if the user asks for it.

Write the proposal after the last run of the heal loop: `report.mjs` archives a proposal older
than the run, and only a proposal written after the latest run classifies its failures.

## Gotcha
- chrome-devtools MCP must be connected for live inspection. If absent, diagnose from the
  failure screenshot and trace (`npx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>`), and reproduce the step
  with a scratch Playwright script against the live page.
